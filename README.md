## **Objective**

This assessment evaluates your ability to build a visually appealing, functional, and responsive frontend for the **Experteaze** platform using **Next.js**, **MobX for state management**, and **MUI Components** along with custom styling.

Try your best to stick with MUI Components and avoid using HTML Elements unless there is no other way.

   - Design a landing page with:
     - A header containing a logo placeholder, navigation links, and a "Login" button.
     - A search bar prominently displayed in a hero section.
     - A placeholder hero image/banner, same as what's on the current experteaze.ca landing page.
2. **Search Functionality**
   - Implement a search bar where users can type the type of service theyâ€™re looking for (e.g., "Yard Work," "Painting").
   - Dynamically display a list of services matching the search query.
3. **Service Cards**
   - Display search results as styled cards, each containing:
     - Service Name
     - Freelancer Name
     - Price (e.g., "$50/hour")
     - Ratings
     - A "Compare" button.
4. **Comparison Table**

     - Freelancer Names
     - Prices
     - Ratings (hardcoded dummy data).

     - `Header`
     - `SearchBar`
     - `ServiceCard`
     - `ComparisonTable`
     - etc.
4. **API Simulation**
   - Use a mock data file (e.g., `services.json`) to simulate API responses for the search functionality.
5. **Additional Features (Optional)**
